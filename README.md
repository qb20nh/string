# String Simulator

This project is an interactive web application for simulating the winding of a string around pins on a 2D canvas. It is implemented in JavaScript and runs entirely in the browser.

## Current State

This repository currently contains an early prototype of the application. Pins can be placed and moved and basic string segments can be drawn between pins. Advanced geometry for wrapping and intersection detection has not yet been implemented.

## Planned Features

- Place, move, resize, and delete pins.
- Draw a string from pin to pin with support for wrapping around pins.
- Detect and prevent self-intersections of the string.
- Animated feedback when hovering or deleting elements.
- Keyboard shortcuts for tool selection.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run the app locally. All code lives in the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.

Contributions are welcome.
